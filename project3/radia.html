		<h3>A Biography</h3>

		<p>Radia Joy Perlman (born 1951) is a software designer and network engineer. She is most famous for her invention of the spanning-tree protocol (STP), which is fundamental to the operation of network bridges, while working for Digital Equipment Corporation. She also made large contributions to many other areas of network design and standardization, such as link-state protocols, including TRILL, which she invented to correct some of the shortcomings of spanning-trees.(Wikipedia)</p>

		<p>Dr. Perlman's work has had a profound impact on how networks self-organize and move data. Her innovations enable todayâ€™s link state routing protocols to be robust, scalable, and easy to manage. The particular protocol she designed in the 1980s (IS-IS) continues to flourish for routing IP today. She designed the spanning tree algorithm that transformed Ethernet from the original limited-scalability, single-wire CSMA/CD, into a protocol that can handle large clouds. Later, she improved on spanning tree-based Ethernet by designing TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links), which allows Ethernet to make optimal use of bandwidth.(Internet Hall)</p>

		<p>When Radia Perlman attended MIT in the late '60s and '70s, she was one of just a few dozen women (about 50) out of a class of 1,000. There were so few other women around, she told me, that she often didn't even notice the gender imbalances and it became normal to her to never see another woman. It wasn't until she had class with another female, "that I'd notice that it kind of looked weird this other gender person looking curiously out of place in the crowd. I'd have to remind myself that I was also that 'other gender.' "(Rosen)<p>

		<p>As an undergraduate at MIT she undertook a UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunity), in lieu of course units, within the LOGOLab at the (then) MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Working under the supervision of Seymour Papert, she developed a child-friendly version of the educational robotics language LOGO, called TORTIS ("Toddler's Own Recursive Turtle Interpreter System"). During research performed in 1974,6 young children the youngest aged 3 years, programmed a LOGO educational robot called a Turtle. Radia has been described as a pioneer of teaching young children computer programming.(Wikipedia)</p>

		<p>Perlman obtained a Bachelor's, Master's in Mathematics, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT in 1988. Her doctoral thesis at MIT addressed the issue of routing in the presence of malicious network failures.(Wikipedia)</p>

		<p>She is most famous for her invention of the spanning-tree protocol (STP), which is fundamental to the operation of network bridges, while working for Digital Equipment Corporation. She also made large contributions to many other areas of network design and standardization, such as link-state protocols, including TRILL, which she invented to correct some of the shortcomings of spanning-trees. She is sometimes referred to as the "Mother of the Internet",a title which she dislikes.(Rosen)</p>

		<p>In an interview she stated, the Internet was not invented by any individual. There are lots of people who like to take credit for it, and it drives them crazy when anyone other than them seems to want credit, so it seems best to just stay out of their way. I did indeed make some fundamental contributions to the underlying infrastructure, but no single technology really caused the Internet to succeed. And sometimes, things get invented multiple times until the time just happens to be right. The thing that happened to be there at the right time isn't necessarily better than the other ones.(Rosen)<p>

		<p>But the Internet's success isn't due to the specific technologies, but rather the surprising ways in which it has come to be used. For instance, Internet search. Itâ€™s astonishing that Internet search is possible at all, but it works amazingly well, and is probably one of the most important reasons that the Internet is ubiquitous.(Rosen)</p>

		<p>Her work transformed the Ethernet protocol from using a few nodes over a limited distance, into something able to create large networks.

		Perlman is the author of one textbook on networking and coauthor of one textbook on network security. She holds more than 100 issued patents.

		She is currently employed by EMC Corporation.(Pasik)</p>
