					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>Alan Mathison Turing was a British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, computer scientist, mathematical biologist, and marathon and ultra distance runner. He was highly influential in the developmemt of computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of "algorithms" and "computations" with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose machine. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Early Life</h3>
					<p>Turing was born in Paddington, Lodon, while his father was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service (ICS) at Chhatrapur, Bihar and Orissa Province, in British India. Turing's father, Julius Mathison Turing (1873-1947), was the son of a clergyman from a Scottish family of merchants which had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet. Julius's wife, Alan's mother, was Ethel Sara, daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the Madras Railways. The Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County Longford, while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare. Julius' work with the ICS brough the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the Bengal Army. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in England, so they moved Maida Vale, London, where Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth, later the Colonnade Hotel. He had an elder brother, John.</p>
					<p>Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius he was later to display prominently. His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque.</p>
					<p>His parents enrolled him at St Michael's at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his subsequent educators. In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School, a well known independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset.</p>
					<p>Turing's natural inclination toward mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928, age 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he grasp it, but he extrapolated Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.</p>

					<h3>University and work on computability</h3>
					<p>After Sherborne, Turning studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, Cambridge, from where he gained first-class honours in mathematics. In 935, at the young age of 22, he was elected a fellow at King's on the strenght of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem, despite the fact that he had failed to find out that it had already been proven in 1922 by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg.</p>
					<p>From September 1936 to July 1938, he spent most of his time studying under Alonzo Church at Princeton University. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier. In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from Princeton; his dissertation, <em>Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals</em>, introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, where Turing machines are augmented with so-called oracles, allowing a study problem that cannot be solved by a Turing machine.</p>

					<h3>Early Computers and the Turing Test</h3>
					<p>From 1945 to 1947, Turing lived in Richmond, London while he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a stored-program computer. Von Neumann's incomplete <em>First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC</em> had predated Turing's paper, but it was much less detailed and, according to John R. Womersley, Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division, it "contained a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing's own". Although ACE was a feasible design, the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on <em>Intelligent Machinery</em> that was not pulished in his lifetime. While he was at Cambridge, the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950. Although the full version of Turing's ACE was never built, a number of computers around the world awe much to it, for example, the English Electric DEUCE and the American Dendix G-15.</p>
					<p>According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institure for Physics, published by Genscher, Düsseldorf (1997), there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse. It took place in Göttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing.</p>

					<h3>Death</h3>
					<p>On June 8th, 1954, Turing's cleaner found him dead. He had died the previous day. A post-mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide, it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at Working Crematorium on the 12th of June 1954. Turing's ashes were scattered there, just as his father's had been.</p>
					<p>Philosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner's historical verdict, suggesting the alternative explanation of the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for gold electroplating spoons, using potassium cyanide to dissolve the gold, which Turing had set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten. In addition, Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment "with good humor" and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death, in fact, setting down a list of tasks he intended to complete upon return to his office after the holiday weekend. At the time, have arranged the cyanide experiment deliberately, to give his mother some plausible deniability.</p>
					<p>Turing's bopgraphers Andrew Hodges and David Leavitt have suggested that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the 1937 Walk Disney film <em>Snow White</em>, his favourite fairy tale, both noting that (in Leavitt's words) he took "an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew"</p>

						<li>On the 23rd of June 1998, on what would have been Turing's 86th birthday, his biographer, Andrew Hodges, unveiled an official English Heritage blue plaque at his birthplace and childhood home in Warrington Crescent, London, later the Colonnade Hotel.</li>
						<li>On the 13th of March 2000, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines issued a set of postage stamps to celebreate the greatest achievements of the 20th century, one of which carries a portrait of Turing against a background of repeated 0s and 1s.</li>
						<li>On the 1st of April 2003, Turing's work at Bletchley Park was named an IEEE Milestone.</li>
						<li>On the 28th of October 2004, a bronze statue of Alan Turing sculpted by John W. Mills was unveiled at the University of Surrey in Guildford marking the 50th anniversary of Turing's death.</li>
