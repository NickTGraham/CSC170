			<h3>Synopsis</h3>
			<p>Marissa Mayer, born on May 30, 1975, in Wausau, Wisconsin, was appointed CEO of Yahoo in 2012. Prior to joining Yahoo, she spent 13 years at Google, where her work in product development largely contributed to the site's unique look and feel. At the time of Mayer's Yahoo appointment, she was one of <em>only 20</em> female CEOs in charge of a Fortune 500 company.</p>

			<h3>Early Life</h3>
			<p>Born in Wausau, Wisconsin, on May 30, 1975, Marissa Ann Mayer has described her early years as a small-town childhood, complete with ballet lessons, ice skating, Brownies and debate team competitions. The daughter of an engineer and an art teacher, Mayer demonstrated an early affinity for math and science. While at Wausau West High, she worked at a local grocery store, where she memorized the number codes for produce items in order to streamline the checkout process.</p>
			<p>Although she grew up thinking she would be a doctor, while at Stanford University, Mayer developed a passion for computers and went on to earn both a Bachelor of Science in symbolic systems and an Master of Science in computer science, with a specialization in artificial intelligence. But it was perhaps her research internships at SRI International in Menlo Park, California, and the UBS research lab in Zurich that helped her net 14 job offers fresh out of grad school.</p>

			<h3>Professional Success</h3>
			<p>Mayer's 14th job offer came from Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who quizzed her on artificial intelligence while sitting at a ping-pong table that the company used for conferences. In 1999, Google wasn't yet an Internet search giant. In fact, the company had <strong>only</strong> 19 employees. Upon accepting an offer to lead Google's user interface and Web server teams, Mayer became the company's 20th employee and its first female engineer.</p>
			<p>Her tenure at Google involved work on some of the company's most recognizable and successful products, including Google Maps, Google Earth, Street View, Google News and Gmail. Known as a fashionista with an eye for design, Mayer is widely credited for the unique look and feel that has come to characterize the Google experience. For example, she was responsible for approving each "doodle" (the custom logos commemorating holidays and events) appearing on the Google home page.</p>
			<p>Mayer spent more than a decade at Google accumulating accolades for her work ethic, eye for detail and vision. In a 2008 interview, however, she seemed to be looking ahead to her next act. <em>"I helped build Google,"</em> Mayer said, <em>"but I don't like to rest on [my] laurels. I think the most interesting thing is what happens next."</em></p>

      <p>What happened next for Mayer captured tremendous interest both in Silicon Valley and around the world. In July 2012, she was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo, a company besieged by declining stock prices, layoffs and slowing ad revenue.</p>
      <p>Tasked with course-correcting the company, Mayer became the fifth CEO hired by Yahoo in five years, as well as one of only 20 women running a Fortune 500 company. As a female technology CEO, Mayer follows in the footsteps of former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman. And many believe that she just may have what it takes to turn Yahoo around.</p>
      <p>In September of 2013, Mayer was ranked number one by Fortune magazine in its annual "40 Under 40" list of business leaders. <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/marissa-mayer-20902689">[1]</a></p>

			<h3>Yahoo Controversy</h3>
			<p>Eric Jackson of Forbes wrote the following about Mayer's recent finances:</p>
			<p>Mayer is not the first CEO to negotiate a jaw-dropping lucrative compensation package from a board of directors and she certainly won’t be the last.  I can’t really blame her for asking for the moon in compensation and being granted it.  I am very disappointed in the stumbling decline of value of Yahoo’s core business however.</p>
			<p>I’m also highly disappointed that – given the <strong>terrible</strong> results of the core – Mayer has been aggressively selling down her vested stock options every two weeks since February.  In total, she’s sold almost $12 million in stock options since February.  You can find all the transactions <a href="http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001550608&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=only&amp;count=100">here</a>, but I will summarize.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>On August 5th, she sold $620k in stock</li>
				<li>On July 25th, she sold $540k in stock</li>
				<li>On July 14th, she sold $580k in stock</li>
				<li>On June 30th, she sold $530k in stock</li>
				<li>On June 12th, she sold $620k in stock</li>
				<li>On June 3rd, she sold $570k in stock</li>
				<li>On May 19th, she sold $540k in stock</li>
				<li>On May 2nd, she sold $610k in stock</li>
				<li>On April 17th, she sold $530k in stock</li>
				<li>On April 3rd, she sold $630k in stock</li>
				<li>On March 19th, she sold $720k in stock</li>
				<li>On March 6th, she sold $740k in stock</li>
				<li>On March 3rd, she sold $3.06m in stock</li>
				<li>On February 11th, she sold $650k in stock</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In total, she’s sold <strong>$11.6 million</strong> in stock in the last six months.  All of these sales have been done under something called the SEC Rule 10b5-1.  It’s a system under which executives can sign up in advance to sell a predetermined number of shares (or options) at a predetermined price.  Because it’s all done in advance, you don’t run into the problems that Steve Jobs and others had 10 years ago when they were accused of back-dating stock options to get the most favorable stock prices for themselves</p>
			<p>So, Mayer’s sales are certainly legal but they aren’t right in my view.  I’ve had some financial advisors tell me that they think it’s okay for CEOs and executives to sell their stock holdings aggressively because so much of their total net worth is tied up in the stock that this allows for better <em>“diversification.”</em>  If I was a CEO with a $200 million comp package, I’d certainly expect my financial advisor to tell me this was perfectly fine.</p>
			<p>But I don’t buy this argument.  As an investor – and if I was an employee – I want all a CEO’s net worth tied up in a company.  I want them to feel like their future wealth and reputation depends on their current company being really successful.  I think it sends the wrong message to employees to be selling $650,o00 in stock every two weeks for walking around money in your pocket.</p>
			<p>And given the terrible results of the core business, if anything, I believe Mayer should be digging into her own pocket and buying Yahoo stock, not selling it.  If you believe in the “daily habits” strategy for Yahoo, then shout it from the rooftops and put your own money where your mouth is.<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2014/08/17/marissa-mayers-compensation-and-stock-selling-not-linked-to-performance/">[2]</a></p>
